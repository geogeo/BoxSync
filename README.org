* BoxSync
/A client for Box.net/

Since Box.net offer a lifetime upgrade to 50G storage plan for iPhone and Android user.
I decide to turn to Box.net from Dropbox. But the lack of a sync client really ...you know...SUCK!

So I wrote a simple sync client for who like dropbox client and the Box.net's 50G storage

** Features
Now it only has the following simple features:(now only *oneway(client=>Box)* sync implemented)
-upload new folders and files 
-delete files &folders 
-rename files & folders
-move files & folders

** TODO Tasks								:dsf:
-two way sync during  a presetting time
-share folders and files
-sync multiple Folders
-upload processing bar
-maybe GUI version


Sorry for my poor english, but I think you still got what I mean ;)
Test it for me or DONATE to keep it Alive, THANKU!

* BoxSync
/A client for Box.net/

** Why BoxSync

Since Box.net offer a lifetime span 50G storage plan for iPhone and Android user.
I decide to turn to Box.net from Dropbox. But the lack of a *FREE* sync
client really ...you know.. *SUCK*!

So I wrote a simple sync client for who like to sync your Box.net's
50G storage  just Like DropBox Client


=But it's a alpha version(I am testing right now), so you better don't sync any importent
folder for now=

** Features
Now it only has the following simple features:(only *oneway(client=>Box)* sync implemented)
-upload new folders and files 
-delete files &folders 
-rename files & folders
-move files & folders
-upload processing bar

** TODO Tasks								:dsf:
-two way sync during  a presetting time
-share folders and files
-sync multiple Folders
-maybe in GUI version

Test the Code (/or help me do the spellcheck:p in README/) for me or DONATE to keep it
Alive, Really Appreciate!

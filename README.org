* BoxSync beta
/A client for Box.net/

** Why BoxSync

Since Box.net offer a lifetime span 50G storage plan for iPhone and Android user.
I decide to turn to Box.net from Dropbox. But the lack of a *FREE* sync
client really ...you know.. *SUCK*!

So I wrote a simple sync client for who like to sync your Box.net's
50G storage  just Like DropBox Client


*NOW it's a BETA version, but still better don't sync any importent folder for now*

** Features
Now it only has the following simple features:(Try the new 2way sync <=> Version!!)
-upload new folders and files 
-delete files &folders 
-rename files & folders
-move files & folders
-modified local file will be transmited to Box
-upload processing bar
-download processing bar
-two way sync during at startup

** TODO Tasks								:dsf:
-share folders and files
-sync multiple Folders
-maybe in GUI version

Test the Code (/or help me do the spellcheck:p in README/) for me or DONATE to keep it
Alive, Really Appreciate!
